                                Meat to Get Enough Protein?</div>
                            <div class="collapsible-body"><p class="text-justify"><span class="Poppins-SemiBold">Fact:</span> Nuts, seeds, legumes and wholegrains are all
                                    sources of protein – and eating a variety of protein rich plant foods (legumes,
                                    wholegrains, nuts, seeds) each day can give your body all the protein it needs for
                                    good health. The key is to eat a variety of these foods every day to make sure you
                                    get the best balance of essential amino acids. Some foods such as soy beans, quinoa
                                    and amaranth are particularly high in quality plant protein and provide all of the
                                    essential amino acids you need in the one food.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Compared to meat, plant protein
                                    foods offer the additional benefits of fibre, low amounts of saturated fat, vitamins
                                    and minerals like iron and zinc and thousands of antioxidants and phytochemicals.
                                    Harvard University researchers say that eating more plant proteins and less meat
                                    protein offers you greater protection against chronic diseases like heart disease
                                    and diabetes.</p></div>

                                    Although these diets do lead to rapid, short-term weight loss (which is mostly water
                                    weight), the research suggests that they are no better than other weight loss diets
                                    over the long-term, and that most people following a low-carb diet gain the weight
                                    back over time. Additionally, long-term studies consistently show that adherence to
                                    a low-carb diet is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. In
                                    other words, low-carb diets may lead to some perceived short-term benefits, but they
                                    are at the expense of our long-term and overall health.</p></div>

                                    has recently gained momentum as a "superfood". Most of the health claims circulating
                                    the internet regarding apple cider vinegar are totally unsubstantiated. However,
                                    there is some research suggesting that adding vinegar to a meal can help lower
                                    post-prandial blood sugar levels. This could be any type of vinegar, however, as
                                    there doesn't appear to be anything special about apple cider vinegar. So, try to
                                    cook with more vinegar, as it may have some health benefits, but it's not a magic

                                    in extreme physical exercise. A 2019 study in the Journal of the International

                                    makes alcohol—is what raises levels of protective HDL, or good cholesterol, and

                            <div class="collapsible-body"><p class="text-justify">It’s easy to trace this myth back to its origin.
                                    Digestion does raise your metabolism a little, so many people believe that eating
                                    less food more often keeps your metabolism elevated.However, the size of the meal
                                    matters, too: fewer but larger meals means fewer but larger spikes in metabolism.
                                    Moreover, some studies suggest that having smaller meals more often makes it harder
                                    to feel full, potentially leading to increased food intake.[94]
                                    More to the point, the evidence shows that, given an equal amount of daily calories,
                                    the number of meals makes no difference in fat loss.
                                    The Truth: Digestion does slightly increase your metabolic rate, but the frequency
                                    of your meals will have less effect on your weight than their total caloric content
